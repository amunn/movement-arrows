# `movement-arrows` package

Copyright 2017-2023 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>

This package supplies simple support for drawing movement arrows on example sentences. It automatically adjusts spacing between examples or gloss lines to make room for the arrows.  Arrows can also be annotated with labels.  The package uses TikZ as a base, and various properties of the arrows can be adjusted using TikZ styles.

The package has been tested with the `gb4e`, `linguex`, and `ExPex` example packages.
