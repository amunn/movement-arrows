# `movement-arrows` package

Version 2.0 2023-06-02

Copyright 2017-2023 by Alan Munn <amunn@msu.edu>

This package supplies simple support for drawing  arrows between elements in text or math. Its origin comes from linguistics, where drawing arrows between words is often used as an indication that the word or phrase has moved, hence the package name.  Because of this origin, the package is aware of the main linguistics packages for example sentences and can be used with those packages, but does not require you to use of any of them.  Arrows can also be annotated with labels.  The package uses TikZ as a base, and various properties of the arrows can be adjusted using TikZ styles. 

The package has been tested with the `gb4e`, `linguex`, `covington` and `ExPex` example packages.
